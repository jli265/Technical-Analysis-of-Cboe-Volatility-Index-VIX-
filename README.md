# Technical-Analysis-of-Cboe-Volatility-Index-VIX

To predict future trend of VIX prices, I built a GARCH (1,1) model in Matlab and used 5-year historical data to estimate MLE parameters. Results showed that natural trend of VIX log return is a daily 101-basis-point decline after removal of error terms. Robustness test was conducted by reducing time series data. In addition, I ran Monte Carlo Simulation to predict VIX prices on May 2020. VIX prices would go below $30 a few days after May.
